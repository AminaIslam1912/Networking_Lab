The TCP/IP model, also known as the Internet Protocol Suite, is a foundational set of communication protocols that enables the internet to function. It defines how data is packaged, transmitted, and received across networks, ensuring reliable and efficient communication. The model is often described as a four-layer or five-layer architecture, with each layer performing specific tasks.
